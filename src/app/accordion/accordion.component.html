        <p class="no-marge-p"> With Systemd, system shutdown can take several minutes and DNS resolving is not always reliable. There are also problems with kernel keyring management and cgroups.</p> 
        <p class="no-marge-p">Many systemd-free distros use elogind. It's basically systemd-logind, extracted out to be a standalone daemon. This was supposed to be a <span class="default-highlight">temporary dirty solution</span> to make Gnome compatible with systemd-free distro but it has become the standard. Elogind has a lot of dead code and bugs in sleep/hibernate mode. ConsoleKit2 is superior because the most reliable code is the smallest code. I have used Devuan with ConsoleKit2 and it works great.</p>

        <p class="no-marge-p">One of the critical arguments against systemd is the lack of portability to other Unices and the possibility that Linux-based systems using systemd would detach from the UNIX world. OpenBSD, FreeBSD and other BSD OSes are de facto incompatible with systemd and <strong><span class="default-highlight">any software that hard-depend on systemd</span></strong>.</p>
        <p class="no-marge-p">Gnome and gvfs require elogind, so some FreeBSD devs want to replace ConsoleKit2 with elogind. This is a very bad idea. Gnome and Systemd are poisoning the Linux ecosystem!
