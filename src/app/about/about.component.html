                    The current state of privacy is catastrophic. Data breaches are everywhere. Chances are that your WhatsApp login is on the darknet. Medical data might be shared with marketers. Employers and insurrance companies might access these sensitive data and discriminate people. In addition, thousands of Script kiddies and cyber-punks want to hack you... It's time to think about how to protect computer users' privacy.</p>

                <p class="no-marge-p">
                    Sophisticated cyber-attacks combine:
                </p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                    <li>the knowledge of your mobile phone number and your email address to send you malicious queries related to (fake) orders (paypal, amazon, ...)</li>
                    <li>malware to redirect you to fake website that mimic the shopping/booking website you use</li>
                    <li>malware to read your paypal/amazon login</li>
                    <li>the knowledge of your family/friends to impersonate them</li>
                </ul>

                    The best protection is to use FOSS (free and open source) software on Linux/*BSD, to browse shopping/booking websites on Linux/*BSD and to <span class="default-highlight">avoid installing apps on your smartphone</span>. No WhatsApp, no Facebook, no Google Contacts/Gmail. <br> Wi-Fi is insecure as fuck, better use 4G/5G networks.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p"> For computers, <span class="default-highlight"> reducing the attack surface</span> is the key. Some bloated software can be avoided. The list is long: MS Windows, MacOS, ChromeOS, closed-source software such as Adobe pdf reader, Google Chrome, Opera, MS Edge and Slack. Some open-source software are also suspected to contain bugdoors: Electron apps, Chromium, Firefox and VLC are examples.
                    <br>For Linux users: Closed-source drivers/firmware, Gnome, Systemd and Snap should be avoided. Flatpak is dangereous because most apps can access the microphone and home folder. Flatpak is not security-focused. In addition, it is important to regularly inspect the list of open ports. There should be none except those absolutely needed. And even there, check whether the service can be moved to 127.0.0.1 or ::1.

                <p class="default-p">For email communication, using encryption helps protect the privacy of people you communicate with. GnuPG allows to encrypt your emails with a public key and a private key. </p>
                <p class="default-p">What if you need to submit a rental application with employment information, your social security number, address? The recipient doesn't use GnuPG and you don't want that application sitting around in your email sent folder, or the recipient’s inbox forever. Shame on organizations which handle your sensitive data without any security. The only solution is to avoid relying on those organizations... but it's not always possible.</p>

                    <p class="default-p">
                        GrSecurity brings additional patches to the mainline Linux kernel in order to enhance the security. Since April 2017, it is no longer free to the public. It is available only to paying customers of Open Source Security, Inc. Many Linux users have since considered that the mainline Linux kernel is not enough secure. A free and hardened kernel is under development but IMHO it’s not worth GrSecurity. <br>The kernel devs have almost lost control on their kernel since version 6.1. Sometimes, they merge code from third-parties  <span class="default-highlight"> without review</span>. I have seen unsigned kernel modules from Broadcom on some Debian-based OSs. The FSF is struggling to remove all this code for building the linux-libre kernel. The Hyperbola team is so disappointed that Hyperbola GNU/Linux-libre is switching to an OpenBSD base.
