                    The current state of privacy/security is catastrophic. Data breaches are everywhere. Chances are that your WhatsApp login is on the darknet. Medical data might be shared with marketers. Employers and insurrance companies might access these sensitive data and discriminate people. In addition, thousands of Script kiddies and cyber-punks want to hack you... It's time to think about how to protect computer users' privacy.</p>

                    The best protection is to use FOSS (free and open source) software on Linux/*BSD, to browse shopping/booking websites on Linux/*BSD and to <span class="default-highlight">avoid installing apps on your smartphone</span>. No WhatsApp, no Facebook, no Google Contacts/Gmail. <br> Wi-Fi is insecure as fuck, better use 4G/5G networks.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p"> For computers, <span class="default-highlight"> reducing the attack surface</span> is the key. Some bloated software can be avoided. The list is long: MS Windows, MacOS, ChromeOS, closed-source software such as Adobe pdf reader, Google Chrome, Opera, MS Edge and Slack. Some open-source software are also suspected to contain bugdoors: Electron apps, Chromium, Firefox and VLC are examples.
                    <br>For Linux users: Closed-source drivers/firmware, GNOME, Systemd and Snap should be avoided. Flatpak is dangereous because most apps can access the microphone and home folder. Flatpak is not security-focused. In addition, it is important to regularly inspect the list of open ports. There should be none except those absolutely needed. And even there, check whether the service can be moved to 127.0.0.1 or ::1.

If you really need bloated web browsers or electron apps, then I recommend to sandbox them with Bubblejail or at least to log as another user to use these apps. The dedicated user should not belong to sudo group (to avoid sudo password sniffing). To create a new user called 'mesnate', simply do: useradd -m mesnate; passwd mesnate

The recipient doesn't use GnuPG and you don't want that application sitting around in your email sent folder, or the recipientâ€™s inbox forever. Shame on organizations which handle your sensitive data without any security. The only solution is to avoid relying on those organizations... but it's not always possible.</p>

                    <p class="default-p">
                        The kernel devs have almost lost control on their kernel since version 6.1. Sometimes, they merge code from third-parties  <span class="default-highlight"> without review</span>. I have seen unsigned kernel modules from Broadcom on some Debian-based OSs. According to the Kicksecure team, old LTS kernels, such as 5.10, have the smallest attack surface. The FSF is struggling to remove all the non-free code for building the linux-libre kernel. However they are powerless regarding the growing attack surface in new kernels. The Hyperbola team is so disappointed that Hyperbola GNU/Linux-libre is switching to an OpenBSD base.
                        <br>GrSecurity brings additional patches to the mainline Linux kernel in order to enhance the security. Since April 2017, it is no longer free to the public. It is available only to paying customers of Open Source Security, Inc. A free and inferior solution is to read the Kernel Self Protection Project (KSPP) guidelines. 
                        KSPP provides a set of hardening options. Most distros apply a subset of the available hardening options when building their kernels. Arch/Artix Linux provide a package called 'linux-hardened', which implements all the KSPP recommendations. This kernel is optimized for servers and VMs. For daily Desktop usage, I don't recommend this kernel because of poor performance. Some distros, namely ParrotOS and Fedora, apply a configuration to harden the default kernel. Sadly, these distros use systemd and non-free firmware. I recommend to manually apply a similar config to a systemd-free system. It will prevent privilege escalation attacks through restricted ptrace access and disabled unprivileged BPF operations, while eliminating core dump generation to reduce attack surface.
