                    The current state of privacy is catastrophic. Data breaches are everywhere. Chances are that your WhatsApp login is on the darknet. Medical data might be shared with marketers. Employers and insurrance companies might access these sensitive data and discriminate people... It's time to think about how to protect computer users' privacy.</p>
                <p class="default-p"> <span class="default-highlight"> Reducing the attack surface</span> is the key. Some bloated software can be avoided. The list is long: Snap, electron apps, Gnome, ... Flatpak is dangereous because most apps can access the microphone and home folder.

                        The kernel devs have lost control on their kernel since version 6.1. Sometimes, they merge code from third-parties  <span class="default-highlight"> without review</span>. I have seen unsigned kernel modules on some Debian-based OSs. The FSF is struggling to remove all this code for building the linux-libre kernel.
